# WeRateDogs-Twitter

An analysis of the Twitter archive of user WeRateDogs using Python and Tweepy API. 

### Gathering Data

There were three main sources of data for this project:
* a csv file of the WeRateDogs Twitter archive
* a [URL](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv) that contained data in a tsv file on the image predictions of a subset of the tweets using a neural network
* the retweet and favorite counts of each tweet in the Twitter API

### Cleaning Data

After making some visual and programmatic assessments of the three sets of gathered data, I cleaned it to make the data easier to work with.
